## Installation üöÄ

1. [Create a new volto project](https://github.com/plone/volto#create-a-volto-project-using-the-generator), if you don't have one.
1. Clone this repository i.e. `volto-educal-theme`, the [Hero Block](https://github.com/collective/volto-educal-hero-block) and the [Pre-footer block](https://github.com/collective/volto-block-banner) in the `src/addons` directory of the volto project.
1. Now we will be linking the cloned repositories:

   1. Add `@plone-collective/volto-educal-theme` as an array member under the `addons` property in the volto project's `package.json`.

   1. Add `src/addons/volto-educal-theme`, `src/addons/volto-block-banner` and `src/addons/volto-educal-hero-block` as array members under the `workspaces` property in the volto project's `package.json`.

   1. Finally, the volto project's `package.json` should include the following lines:

   ```json
     "workspaces": [
       "src/addons/volto-educal-theme",
       "src/addons/volto-block-banner",
       "src/addons/volto-educal-hero-block"
     ],
     "addons": ["@plone-collective/volto-educal-theme"]
   ```

   **REMEMBER:**

   - You just need to add this in your volto project's `package.json` file and not in any of the add-ons `package.json` file.
   - If you are stuck, you can refer the change [here](https://github.com/avimishra18/volto_educal/blob/48328f5551678f26cae02f1bdc6268b2de47ad26/package.json#L40-L47)
   - For a more detailed guide, on how to install an add-on in volto [visit here](https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/addons/index.html#loading-addon-configuration).

     import '@plone/volto/../theme/themes/pastanaga/extras/extras.less';
   ```
