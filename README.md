## Installation üöÄ

1. [Create a new volto project](https://github.com/plone/volto#create-a-volto-project-using-the-generator), if you don't have one.
1. Add the following packages to the `mrs.developer.json` file of your volto project.

   ```json
   {
     "volto-educal-hero-block": {
       "url": "git@github.com:collective/volto-educal-hero-block.git",
       "https": "https://github.com/collective/volto-educal-hero-block.git",
       "package": "@plone-collective/volto-educal-hero-block",
       "branch": "main",
       "path": "src"
     },
     "volto-block-banner": {
       "url": "git@github.com:collective/volto-block-banner.git",
       "https": "https://github.com/collective/volto-block-banner.git",
       "package": "@plone-collective/volto-block-banner",
       "branch": "main",
       "path": "src"
     },
     "volto-educal-theme": {
       "url": "git@github.com:collective/volto-educal-theme.git",
       "https": "https://github.com/collective/volto-educal-theme.git",
       "package": "@plone-collective/volto-educal-theme",
       "branch": "main",
       "path": "src"
     }
   }
   ```

1. Now link the add-on in the volto project:

   1. Make sure the `private` field is set to `true` in the volto project's `package.json`. As [yarn workspaces can only be enabled in private projects](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/#toc-how-to-use-it).

   1. Add `src/addons/*` as array members under the `workspaces` property in the volto project's `package.json`.

   1. Add `@plone-collective/volto-educal-theme` as an array member under the `addons` property in the volto project's `package.json`.

   Finally, the volto project's `package.json` should include the following lines:

   ```json
   {
     "private": true,
     "workspaces": ["src/addons/*"],
     "addons": ["@plone-collective/volto-educal-theme"]
   }
   ```

   **REMEMBER:**

   - You just need to add this in your volto project's `package.json` file and not in any of the add-ons `package.json` file.
   - For a more detailed guide, on how to install an add-on in volto [visit here](https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/addons/index.html#loading-addon-configuration).

1. Change this line in `src/theme.js` of the volto project.

   ```diff
   - import 'semantic-ui-less/semantic.less';
   + import '@plone-collective/volto-educal-theme/semantic.less';
     import '@plone/volto/../theme/themes/pastanaga/extras/extras.less';
   ```

   You can refer the change [here](https://github.com/avimishra18/volto_educal/blob/main/src/theme.js).

1. [Bootstrap](https://github.com/plone/volto#bootstrap-the-plone-api-backend) the Plone API backend. Alternatively, you can visit the [official documentation](https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/index.html) for other installation options.
1. Run `yarn` to install the node modules. üì¶
1. Run `yarn start` command to start the volto server! üçª
